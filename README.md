### Hi there 👋

I’m a full-stack developer from Iceland.

I build and share my own tools for day-to-day work, with a strong focus on developer experience, automation, and reducing friction. A large part of my time goes into experimenting with architectures, languages, runtimes, and build systems to understand their trade-offs and limits in real projects.

**Languages / Platforms**
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Go
- C#
